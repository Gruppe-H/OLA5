       "' \\n \\nBeginning Knitting  \\n \\nWHAT IS KNITTING? \\n \\nHand knitting is to make fabric with yarn \\non two or more needles.  A number of loops are first made on one needle, and then the fabric \"grows\\'\\' by drawing other loops through them as they are passed back and forth along the needles from row to row. \\n \\nAll knitting comes from two kinds of stitches. One is called a \"knit stitch,\" and the other is called a \"purl stitch.\" There \\nare several different ways or methods of knitting. Refer to directions in the pattern/instructions for explanations and types of stitches required.  \\n \\nKnitting can produce something useful, but the process can,  and should be, fun \\nand relaxing.  The main thing is to learn to enjoy  knitting—relax while you work, \\navoid a cramped position, have a good light to see by, and if your hands become tired, stop and rest a while.  \\nHistory of Knitting \\n \\nKnitting is older than written history. No \\none knows exactly when people began to knit, but we do know that as far back as A.D. 200, knitting was an advanced and accomplished art.  The people of Scotland are believed to have been the first to knit with wool. \\n \\nA knitted fabric stretches more than a woven fabric, and it snaps back to its original size after it is stretched. For \\nexample, a woolen kn itted fabric can \\nstretch as much as 30 percent and spring back to its original size. Long ago people found out how much better a knitted \\nfabric was than a wo ven fabric for  \\nclothing that needs to stretch and then spring back to fit snugly. Sweaters, mittens, and stockings are examples of \\nthis kind of clothing. \\n \\nKnitting is probably more popular today than it has been at any other time in history. With the hundreds of different kinds and textures of yarns available, plus the constant development of new synthetic fibers and various combinations of them, there is no end to the beautiful and useful things you can learn to make.   \\nKNITTING TOOLS \\n \\n\\x88    Knitting Needles   \\nThe first tool that comes to mind \\nwhen we think of knitting is needles. Knitting needles come in many sizes, types, and lengths and are made of different materials.   Quality   - Knitting needles undergo \\na variety of extra finishing steps to ensure a smooth surface without nicks or rough edges.  Size  -  The size of a knitting needle \\nrefers to its diameter. In the United States, knitting needles are sized with numbers ranging from 0 to 50. Sizes 17 to 50 are considered \"jumbo\" or \"jiffy\" size needles. Canadian and European needle sizes are based on the metric system. Some U.S. needles are now labeled with both sizes. When you go shopping, look at the different sizes of needles that are available and compare the United States (standard) and metric measurements. CT-MMB.730'"

       "' 2 \\nAll knitting patterns tell you the size of \\nneedles you will need. Never discard your needles when you have fini shed the project.  \\nIf you lose one needle and have to buy another pair the same size, keep the extra \\nneedle. You never know when you may lose or break another one.   \\n \\n\\x88    Crochet Hook  \\nYou will need a crochet hook to pick \\nup dropped stitches and to correct other mistakes. They also come in many sizes. Size C, or 6, is a good one for 4-ply knitting yarn. \\n \\n\\x88    Measuring Tool  \\nYou will need a measuring tool. You \\ncan use a ruler, a measuring tape, or a metal measuring gauge. Be sure your \\nmeasuring tool has both standard and \\nmetric measurements. \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n\\x88 Other helpful items: \\n \\nScissors  -    You will also want to \\ninclude in your knitting basket a pair of small scissors (kept in a case for safety). \\n \\nYarn needle  -  a blunt-pointed yarn \\nneedle for sewing your articles together. \\n  Nail file or emery board   -  for catchy \\nfingernails. A rough fingernail might catch on the yarn. \\n \\n \\n \\nCase for needles and hooks  - \\nYou can make a handy case for knitting needles by cutting a piece of corrugated paper from a packing carton. Stick your needles (and crochet hooks, too) in the ends of the paper. You can leave the holder flat for storage, or it can be rolled up and fastened with a rubber band. \\n \\n  \\nSmall transparent case   - It is a \\ngood idea to keep all easily lost items, such as rubber tips and tapestry needles, in a small transparent case.   A long, round, narrow plastic medicine bottle will make a very nice case.  Be sure to wash the bottle well before you use it for your needles and other small items. \\n '"

       "\"In, around, under and off. You'll\\xa0 be dreaming this by the end. Hello knitters, i'm Marion from Lovecrafts\\xa0 and I'm going to show you how to knit. Now, in this video we're going to do a\\xa0little project where we start knitting\\xa0from start to finish.  This is the little\\xa0swatch we're going to knit. I'm going to\\xa0show you how to start, how to cast on, how to knit this lovely knit stitch\\xa0\\xa0 and then how to cast off. So, it's everything\\xa0 in one go.  Now if you learn to make one of these, you can make a scarf or a cushion cover or\\xa0a pillow or a blanket - anything at all! \\xa0 So, this is a really good tutorial just for some basic\\xa0ground work before you start your knitting. So, I'm going to use Paint Box wool mix super chunky.\\xa0And the reason i'm using a super chunky yarn\\xa0\\xa0 is because when you start knitting it's really\\xa0important to be able to see the stitches.  Um, and so I always prefer to use a big yarn, and that way your\\xa0work grows very fast, so you don't get demoralised\\xa0\\xa0 and you can see your stitches really clearly when\\xa0 you're starting out. It's personal, you can try\\xa0\\xa0 all kinds, but I prefer a wooden needle and the\\xa0 reason for that is because they're not slippy.  So, when you start knitting you don't want your\\xa0 needles to be slipping all over the place.  So, wooden needles or bamboo needles will keep your\\xa0work anchored nicely on the needle.  Let's start\\xa0with the cast on.  So, there are lots and lots\\xa0of different ways to cast on and I'm going to\\xa0show you a knitted cast on, which is a really\\xa0good way to create quite a stretchy cast on.  So, take your yarn, we're going to start with a slip\\xa0 knot. So, we have the yarn here like this. Make sure you leave a nice long tail because that needs\\xa0to be sewn in later and I'll show you that when\\xa0we get there. But just take the yarn and wind it\\xa0around your fingers. So, you have two fingers like\\xa0that. Now taking the working yarn, this is the\\xa0one attached to the ball, just pull that through\\xa0the circle. And then I'm just going to pull\\xa0that tight. And you can see there that this\\xa0is a slip knot.  Let's do that again.  So,\\xa0I've got the tail going off to the left,\\xa0I've got the working yarn on the right.  So,\\xa0I'm just going to wind that round my finger\\xa0and then just reach through that hole, pull the\\xa0working yarn, and then pull it into a slip knot.\\xa0\\xa0 And that - you can alter the size. So, that's\\xa0 where we're going to start.  I'm going to pop that\\xa0now onto the needle. So, there we are. You've got\\xa0your first stitch on the needle.  Now, to start\\xa0a cast on, we're going to do the knit stitch.\\xa0So, we put the needle and I've got - just look\\xa0at how I'm holding it. I've got this tail\\xa0of the yarn in my hand on the left-hand side,\\xa0the working yarn on the right-hand side\\xa0and this is my right-hand needle. So, I'm going to put my needle diagonally underneath\\xa0into the stitch.  Now, with the working yarn on\\xa0\\xa0my right I'm going to take that yarn,\\xa0bring it round the front of the needle, and then holding these steady, I'm\\xa0going to pull this needle underneath. So, we're now sitting here.. And just pull it a\\xa0 little bit so you've got a loop on each needle.\\xa0\\xa0 Then i'm going to just transfer that first one and\\xa0 pop it on to the left-hand needle. And now we have\\xa0two stitches. So, we're going to do that\\xa0again. This time I'm going to put my needle\\xa0into the right-hand stitch - there we go - in\\xa0diagonally, bring the yarn around the needle,\\xa0\\xa0 pull it down and then across a little\\xa0bit so that you've got two loops.  And\\xa0then transfer this right-hand loop onto\\xa0the left needle. So, now we've got three.\\xa0\\xa0 So, let's do it again.  Put your needle\\xa0diagonally underneath into the stitch,\\xa0bring your working yarn, the one on the right\\xa0here, around the needle then we slide underneath.\\xa0 And then just pull until you've got more of a\\xa0loop and then transfer this right-hand needle\\xa0onto the left.  So, now we have four.  And you\\xa0can see as you complete each stitch this little\\xa0diagonal bit straightens up a bit just in case\\xa0you're worrying.  So, I'm going to start again. So, we put the needle in diagonally underneath,\\xa0 then i'm going to take the working yarn,\\xa0\\xa0 that's the one attached to the ball,\\xa0bring it round the needle, slide it under\\xa0and pull it towards me a little bit.  So, that\\xa0makes the the stitch a little bit bigger.\\xa0\\xa0 And then transfer it onto the left needle.\\xa0 There we go. There's five. Let's do it again.\\xa0\\xa0 Put your needle in diagonally underneath\\xa0 into the stitch, bring your yarn around,\\xa0\\xa0 and then slide the needle underneath and pull it\\xa0towards you.  So, you've got another stitch made\\xa0and transfer it onto the needle.  Now\\xa0you might find when you start this\\xa0it's very difficult to control two needles and\\xa0two pieces of yarn.  So, just go very slowly,\\xa0tuck up this spare yarn into your hand here and\\xa0hold the needle.  So, if I put my needle in here\\xa0again, slide it underneath. If it helps you,\\xa0hold those two together with your left hand,\\xa0so that you've got this hand free.\\xa0   Bring the yarn around the needle.\\xa0\\xa0 And then I find sometimes, if you put your finger\\xa0on the end of that right needle to push it back.\\xa0\\xa0 And then come underneath, pull it towards you,\\xa0and then transfer onto that needle.  Now it looks\\xa0very controlled as i'm doing it here and you\\xa0might find when you start that you're all over the\\xa0place, but just keep going because you just need\\xa0to get these stitches on.  Just keep practicing,\\xa0keep practicing, it doesn't matter how long it\\xa0takes.  So, we go into the bottom of the stitch\\xa0diagonally, bring the yarn around, then we come\\xa0under, pull it towards you  and then transfer\\xa0onto the left-hand needle. So, let's have a look.\\xa0We've got two, four, six, eight stitches there.\\xa0\\xa0 So, let's create 15. So, I put the needle\\xa0in, yarn around, pull it underneath,\\xa0pull it towards you, and transfer it.  So, we\\xa0go again. Put your needle in, the yarn around,\\xa0push the needle under, pull it towards you,\\xa0and transfer it.  Let's have a look now. Two, four, six, eight, ten stitches.  Let's do\\xa0another five.  So, your needle in, yarn around,\\xa0\\xa0push it back, and then bring it towards you\\xa0and then transfer the stitch. I'll do it again. So, this gives us 12.  See, when you\\xa0see this little crisscross here, don't\\xa0worry about that that's normal.\\xa0 So,\\xa0we put the needle in, yarn around,\\xa0pull it towards you, and then transfer the stitch. The needle in, yarn around, push\\xa0the needle back and underneath,\\xa0bring it towards you, and then transfer\\xa0it.  Let's have a little count - two, four, six,\\xa0eight, ten, twelve, fourteen. Just one more to go. Needle in - you can even balance it on your\\xa0thumb there if that helps you.  Just hold the\\xa0\\xa0needles together, bring your yarn around, and then\\xa0you slide underneath, bring the needle through,\\xa0\\xa0 pull it towards you, and transfer. Okay. So, there we have 15 stitches cast on. So, okay here we are ready to\\xa0start knitting. So, i've got the tail of the yarn on the left-hand side here. I've\\xa0got my working yarn connected to the ball of yarn on the right. And we're going to do a very\\xa0similar stitch than we just did for casting on.\\xa0\\xa0 Um, again, this one is a little bit sideways.\\xa0 That's fine, that's exactly how it should be.\\xa0\\xa0 And that's your little nice cast on edge. So,\\xa0I'm going to take the needle like we did before. Diagonally underneath the stitch, we\\xa0bring the working yarn around the needle.. Slide it through.. Now this time - oops -\\xa0we're going to slide it off the needle.\\xa0\\xa0 There we go. Let's do that one again. We put the\\xa0 needle in and underneath, bring the yarn around,\\xa0\\xa0 slide it under, and then off. So, let's try\\xa0that again. We put the needle into the stitch diagonally underneath, you bring your working yarn\\xa0around the needle,  push the needle underneath and\\xa0down, and then bring it through and then off.  Now,\\xa0when you work this first row it's often quite a\\xa0tight row to work. So, just try not to pull your\\xa0yarn too tight. Just try and keep the yarn nice\\xa0and relaxed. If you tighten up these stitches,\\xa0they're going to be much harder to move around.\\xa0\\xa0 So, just try and keep them as loose as you can.\\xa0 So, we're going to put the needle into the stitch,\\xa0\\xa0 around, under and off. And you can\\xa0keep just shimmying these stitches up to the top of the needle. So, that\\xa0they're not on the end but near the end, so you don't have to travel very far.  So, then\\xa0we put the needle in and underneath, around the\\xa0right-hand needle, push this one down and under\\xa0and then slide it off. Let's do another one. Into the stitch, bring your yarn around the\\xa0needle, come under and then off.  So, we go in,\\xa0around, under and off. There are lots of these\\xa0little rhymes that you can learn to remind yourself but that's the easiest one.  So, we go\\xa0in, around, under and off. So, we go in, around, under, and off.  Just say that to yourself. There\\xa0we go. In, around, under and off. Now, you know, it doesn't matter how you hold your needles. So,\\xa0some people - I'm holding them like this in a\\xa0face with open palms. You might find it's easier\\xa0if you hold your needles this way.  So, you might\\xa0find it easier with your hand on top.  So, if I\\xa0try that you go under - sorry - into the stitch,\\xa0around, under and off. In, around, under\\xa0and off. Remember there is no right way\\xa0to hold your needle. So, whatever's\\xa0comfy for you, you do that. In, around, under and off. And we've just got two\\xa0 more stitches to take us to the end of the row.\\xa0\\xa0 In, around, under and off. In, around, under\\xa0and off. And so, when you've completed that first row - look at that lovely work - then\\xa0what we do is we turn this needle around. So, that you have these little lovely bumps facing\\xa0 you. And we're ready to start the second row.\\xa0\\xa0 So, we're going to work in exactly the\\xa0same way for this row.  Now this stitch,\\xa0\\xa0sometimes it's called the knit stitch\\xa0sometimes it's called garter stitch,\\xa0\\xa0 um, is the main.. Is the basic knitting stitch\\xa0 that you use for absolutely everything.  There are\\xa0only two knitting stitches and this is the first\\xa0one that everybody learns.  So, let's start again. In, around, under and off. You see this is\\xa0a lot looser, this second row. In, around, under and off. And that's because\\xa0you've sort of freed up your first\\xa0row, which is always, always a bit\\xa0tighter than the others. In, around, under\\xa0and off. You see the way the stitches are\\xa0just transferring onto this right needle. In, around, under and off. I'll do a couple\\xa0 more of those. In, around under and off.\\xa0\\xa0 Looking very nice. In, around, under and off.\\xa0 And just keep repeating that as you go. It won't take long for your hands to develop the muscle\\xa0 memory that you need to remember this stitch.\\xa0\\xa0 So, in around, under, and off. Let's try it. Just\\xa0if you want to try it with your hands on the top\\xa0there again. In, around, under and off. And you\\xa0might find that when you're doing this, this\\xa0needle wobbles around a little bit and it's a bit\\xa0awkward to hold.  Just steady it with your other\\xa0hand. So, if you find that you're just sort of\\xa0 dangling a bit, just hold it with your thumbs,\\xa0 and it is a bit like, you know, learning to drive when\\xa0you can't do everything in one go, but just try\\xa0and keep yourself steady rather than letting them\\xa0dangle.  So, this front needle goes underneath, the left.  So, we go around,\\xa0under, and off. In, around,\\xa0under and off. In, around, under and\\xa0off. So, two more stitches to go. And there we go. Second row. Okay, let's get\\xa0ready for row three. So, we're going to work in exactly the same way.  So, I've got hold of\\xa0my needle here. Right-hand needle we go into\\xa0the stitch diagonally and underneath, the working\\xa0yarn round the needle and we come under and off.\\xa0\\xa0 Notice i'm just using my finger there on the\\xa0 end of the needle to push the stitches along.\\xa0\\xa0 You want to keep them loose but not too loose\\xa0 and not too near the edge. You don't want to\\xa0\\xa0 risk them falling off. But on the other hand\\xa0you don't want to have to drag them off. So,\\xa0that's about the right distance.\\xa0   So, then we're going to go in,\\xa0\\xa0around, under and off. Again don't be afraid\\xa0to hold on to the needles and steady them.\\xa0\\xa0 In, around, under and off. Just push them down a\\xa0 bit. In, around, under and off. You'll be dreaming this by the end. In, around, under and off.  And\\xa0I'll just show you, in case you've decided to\\xa0put your hands on the tops of your needles, that's\\xa0fine.  In, - and i'm just securing this needle with\\xa0my thumb there, just holding the two together -\\xa0you can see.  Around, under, and off. In, around,\\xa0under and off.  And remember there's no, you\\xa0know, there's no right or wrong way to hold your\\xa0needles. It's whatever is comfortable for you.\\xa0\\xa0 So, in, around, under and off. So, there we go. Around, under and off. You can see that little,\\xa0 nice little garter ridge beginning to form there.\\xa0\\xa0 In, around, under and off.\\xa0 Just a couple more to go. And then I've got the last stitch there. In,\\xa0around, under and off. So, there we are.\\xa0\\xa0 So far, three rows. And what I'm going to do, is I'm going to knit\\xa0a few more rows now and then come back and\\xa0show you how to cast off.  Okay, so here we are\\xa0ready to cast off. A cast off literally just\\xa0means that we're going to get rid of all these\\xa0stitches along the top to make a nice neat edge.\\xa0\\xa0 So, it's either called casting off or binding off.\\xa0And you might see it in a pattern as bind off,\\xa0\\xa0cast off. And again there are lots of different\\xa0ways to do this but i'm just going to show you\\xa0a very basic cast off. But before I do that, I\\xa0just want to talk to you about these rows. Now just have a look at this. This is garter stitch,\\xa0 this is knit stitch that we've been doing,\\xa0\\xa0 and it's a lovely stretchy stitch that is\\xa0perfect for if you're making a scarf. Traps\\xa0the air inside so it keeps you nice and warm.\\xa0 When you're counting up your numbers of rows\\xa0one of these nice ridges along there is\\xa0two rows.  So, we can do two, four, six,\\xa0\\xa0eight, ten, twelve and so on. So,\\xa0you can count up your rows like that.\\xa0\\xa0 If you are making a scarf - now this is 15\\xa0stitches in a super chunky yarn - you might\\xa0do 20, and then just carry on knitting, knitting,\\xa0knitting until you reach the length you want.\\xa0\\xa0 And then you can cast off. If you're going to\\xa0 do a cushion then obviously you're going to\\xa0\\xa0 have lots more stitches on there so it's nice and\\xa0 wide. But the process is exactly the same. Right. So, let's cast off from here. So, we're going to\\xa0 start in exactly the same way that we have before.\\xa0\\xa0 So, we're going to knit this first stitch. So, I'm\\xa0going to put my needle in, bring the yarn around,\\xa0under and off. So, knit the first stitch.\\xa0Now we're going to knit the second stitch.\\xa0\\xa0 Yarn around the needle, under, and off. Now\\xa0 once you have two stitches on the needle we\\xa0\\xa0 use this point of the left needle to come\\xa0under the first stitch and lift it over\\xa0the second. And that is one stitch cast off.\\xa0 So, I'm going to now knit the next stitch. Two stitches on the needle. Using this left\\xa0hand point pick up the first one and lift it\\xa0over the second one. So, you can see that's\\xa0cast off. Then we knit the next stitch. Two on the right hand needle, pop the point\\xa0of your left needle under the first one and\\xa0lift it over the second. You can see it's a nice\\xa0neat cast off there. So, we'll do that again.\\xa0\\xa0 Knit the next stitch and lift this first one over\\xa0the second. So, we lift it up, over it goes.  So, we go in, around, under and off. And then use\\xa0this point to lift up the first one and slide it\\xa0under the second. And use this needle to help\\xa0you. So, I'll show you when we knit this stitch,\\xa0\\xa0 I'm going to lift up this first stitch, I'm\\xa0 going to pop my finger on the end there to\\xa0\\xa0 push that through and then just just tip that\\xa0 upwards. So, that you can pull it off.  So, we go yarn around the needle, under and off. I'm\\xa0going to use that point again to dig in there,\\xa0\\xa0 lift the stitch up and pull it over the\\xa0 top. Now again, you know, we talk about\\xa0\\xa0 keeping your stitches nice and relaxed. This will\\xa0 be easier if you're not pulling really tightly.\\xa0\\xa0 So, try and keep your yarn nice and gentle here.\\xa0 So, we knit that stitch again and we're going\\xa0\\xa0 to go under, lift it up and pull it over the top. And knit the next stitch, lift it up over that one and off it comes.  You can see how it's just coming\\xa0off the needles there. So, we go in, around,\\xa0under and off.  Two stitches on the right hand\\xa0needle, lift the first one of the second one.\\xa0\\xa0 Knit the next stitch, lift\\xa0the first one over the second.\\xa0\\xa0 Knit the next stitch, lift the first one over the\\xa0second. So, we've now got just two stitches left.\\xa0\\xa0 So, we're going to knit that stitch. So, you've\\xa0 got these two left on your right hand needle.\\xa0\\xa0 Lift the first and bring it over the second. When\\xa0 you have one needle left, one stitch left on the\\xa0\\xa0 needle, and you're attached, pull this right-hand\\xa0 needle so you've got quite a nice big loop.\\xa0\\xa0 So, you've now got a loop and here's your\\xa0working yarn. So, what we're going to do is snip\\xa0this yarn off Now, it's really important to\\xa0make sure you've got quite a nice long tail here, because we're going to be sewing this in later.\\xa0   So, I'll just grab my scissors snip that off.\\xa0\\xa0 And just have a look at how that\\xa0looks. So, it looks like this. And then i'm just going to pull that end through\\xa0 the loop. Okay? So, then we just pull that gently... And that gives you a secure end. So, here we now\\xa0have our swatch and it has.. This is the cast\\xa0off end and this is our cast on end.  Now, that\\xa0looks absolutely lovely but obviously you can't\\xa0\\xa0leave these big dangly ends. So, I'm just\\xa0going to show you now how to sew those in.\\xa0\\xa0 So, just the last bit of our work.\\xa0We're going to use a nice big\\xa0tapestry needle here to sew these ends in.  Now\\xa0whenever you're working any kind of knitting or\\xa0crochet, anything like that, make sure you leave\\xa0a nice end to sew in so that you can bury it away\\xa0so that it can't be seen in your knitting.  If\\xa0you leave these ends too short, um, what happens\\xa0is it'll unravel and stick up.  And then you've\\xa0got an end sticking up and it won't look nice.\\xa0\\xa0 So, nice long tail. To thread the needle, the\\xa0way that I've always done it - you can stick\\xa0this in your mouth - but it's just nice to..  ...bend\\xa0the yarn around the needle like that and pinch.\\xa0\\xa0 And then thread that through the eye of your\\xa0 needle. Just give it a little wiggle through.\\xa0\\xa0 Now this obviously is very thick yarn so\\xa0 you might not have that trouble when you\\xa0\\xa0 if you've got a thinner yarn. Now the\\xa0 idea here is just to weave with the needle\\xa0\\xa0 in and out to hide this yarn. So, I'm\\xa0just going to take the needle and sew\\xa0underneath the stitches.  Now, sometimes you might\\xa0want to just do it into one loop like that, depending on the sort of needle you're doing. But just weave it along in and out\\xa0\\xa0 to hide your stitches. And once\\xa0you've gone along one way, come back\\xa0the other way.  And this will make sure\\xa0that... I'm going to come down here a bit. This\\xa0 will make sure that your knitting doesn't unravel.\\xa0\\xa0 So, once you've done, usually we sort of say\\xa0 about six little weaves, we can snip that off. You can see that's nicely buried away there so\\xa0 you're not going to see the end of that. So, let's\\xa0\\xa0 do it again up here for your cast on edge or is\\xa0 this cast off I think? So, just thread this needle... And again, just weave the yarn in and out neatly. To hide the end in the yarn. And, uh. when you're working with very fine yarn, um, sometimes - or\\xa0you've got a lace pattern - then it's harder to\\xa0\\xa0 harder to hide the ends. But with nice\\xa0 big yarn like this it's quite simple.\\xa0\\xa0 And then once we've hidden it away,\\xa0\\xa0 snip it off. There you go. So,\\xa0 you can't see those ends now. And that is your piece of knitting from start to\\xa0finish. So, there we are you've completed your first piece of knitting from start to finish. I\\xa0hope you've enjoyed it.  Um don't forget to comment underneath the video if you really enjoyed it and\\xa0tell us what you're going to make.  We'd love to\\xa0know. Are you going to make a scarf or a cushion\\xa0or a pillow?  And don't forget to subscribe to\\xa0\\xa0our channel to learn lots more knitting skills.\\xa0There's so much more to learn - happy knitting!\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\""
